# CLI Bank

A collection of simple programs and CLIs made in Rust and Go, made as a part of learning and revising these languages.

Ideas for Rust CLIs were primarily taken from the book [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) by OReilly Publications, along side some of my own. The guided section of [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) also inspired some cool project ideas for Go!

## Rust CLI's

- [Mandelbrot](./mandelbrot/): Generate PNG images of the Mandelbrot set.
- [QuickReplace](./quickreplace/): Apply regex replacements to the content of a file to generate other files.
